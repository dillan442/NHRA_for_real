<p> Since Wally's top priority was safety, it only makes sense to talk about the improvements in safety. In the very beginning of the NHRA
  the safety was just a simple seatbelt, helmet, and fire suit, but now the safety is practically flawless. Whether your car turned into a
  fireball or a light tap on the wall, the chances of you making it out alive are pretty good. Although, it is still very scary.

     <p> Unfortunately, some of these advancements in safety were caused by deaths from wrecks. The two most recent ones were Scott Kalitta
       from the Kalitta Motorsports racing team and Eric Medlen from the John Force Racing team. In total there have been about 12 deaths
       in the NHRA and it has been an established sport for about 66 years. 12 deaths in 66 years is pretty good, but obviously zero would
       be even better. These tragic accidents range from fire to trauma and everything in between. Despite the fact that the loss of their lives were
       two very tragic events, they have made the sport much safer and I know they would be happy that they have had such a significant
       impact on the sport besides the loss of theiir lives while racing.
