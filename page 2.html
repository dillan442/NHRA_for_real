<h2><center>How it all started<center></h2>
<p>The National Hot Rod Association, was founded by a man named Wallace Gordon "wally" Parks. He is more commonly just called Wally by
  the fans of his amazing creation. His motive for creating the NHRA was to get racers of of the street and onto the track, a much safer
  place. I guess it is safe to say he accomplished his dream. He successfully created the safest way to race, especially with the safety
  safaris, or safety crews, combined with the safety that these cars have, this is a very safe sport that is still very fun to spectate and
  be apart of.
