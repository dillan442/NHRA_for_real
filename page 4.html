<h2><center>These cars only got faster</center></h2>

<p> As of right now, the fastest car in the NHRA and the fastest accelerating vehicle on earth is the Top Fuel Dragster. The name may
  sound odd and a little funny, but this car means business and isn't something to be messed with. It can reach speeds of up to 330 MPH
  in under 4 seconds.

     <p>These weren't always this fast though. In the early years 330 MPH
       wasn't even a thought. The length of the track is a quarter
       mile, or 1,320 FT. At first it would take about 13 seconds maybe
       even more to reach the finish line. Now the fastest car is
       capable in doing in in under 4 seconds. I would say that they
       can't possibly get any faster, but new world records are
         practically set every year.
